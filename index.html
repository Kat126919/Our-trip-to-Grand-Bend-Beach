<h2 style="background-color:Blue;"> Our trip to Grand Bend Beach!</h2>
</body>
</html>
<p> Today, my family decided to go to Grand Bend beach. This is the first time we are going, so we are more excited than we've ever had. It is about 25 to 30 degrees. Since the covid-19 begins, we haven't stepped out of the house other than going to the supermarket. There aren't many covid-19 cases left, so we decided it is the perfect timing to go. We begin our trip after we had breakfast. </p>

<p>The Grand Bend Beach is also named as Lampton shores located in southern shores of Lake Huron. </p>

<p> During the road, we saw a lot of flatlands, farms, wild animals and forests. Grand Bend beach is located at a small county, closed to a tiny town named Stratford. It has a lot of farms, not many housing. Perth County looked like a mini Germany because back then a lot of German people came to Southeast Ontario to live. So that's why many people think southeast Ontario is like a mini Germany. </p>

<p>It is around noon when we've arrived at Grand Bend beach. When we've arrived our family is shocked because it is beyond our expectations.   The colour of the water is as blue as the sky, and the water is as clear as the water that we drink. Grand Bend Beach is gorgeous, none of us expected how beautiful it will be when we have seen it with our own eyes. My sister and I can not wait for another second to get in the water.  Another thing we aren't expecting is that there were so many people; adults of all ages and children of all ages playing in the water or running around and playing on the sand. </P.

<p> Anyways, we found a place to sit down. Once we are settled, my sister and I immediately, not wait for another second we changed in our swimsuit and we jumped in the water. The water is just as warm as we expected. We took a lot of pictures and played in the water all day long until we want to go home. Summer begins.  </p>
